.. function:: get_func_rep(thresh_results, input_comps, conf_values=True)

   Find the functional representation of a set of components based on the results of data mining

   :param thresh_results: The return dictionary from the "get_top_results" function
   :type thresh_results: dict
   :param input_comps: The filename of a .csv file containing the components of a product
   :type input_comps: string
   :param conf_values: A boolean of whether or not to return the results with the frequency values, default is True
   :type conf_values: bool

   :returns: * *learned_dict* -- Returns a dictionary of function and flow combinations sorted by confidence for each component in the input_case.
               The key is the component and the value is a list of function-flow combinations.
             * *unmatched* -- Returns a list of components that were in the set of input components but not found in the data mining results.
