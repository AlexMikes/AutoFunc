.. function:: get_top_results(conf_results, threshold=0.7)

   Use top XX% of results as a threshold for the functions and flows that are associated with each component.

   :param conf_results: The return dictionary from the "find_associations" function
   :type conf_results: dict
   :param threshold: The threshold used for finding the top percentage of confidences
   :type threshold: float

   :returns: Returns a dictionary of function and flow combinations sorted by confidence that sum up to the threshold.
             The key is the component and the value is a list of type: [function-flow, confidence]
   :rtype: return_dict
