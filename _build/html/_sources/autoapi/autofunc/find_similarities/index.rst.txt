.. py:module:: autofunc.find_similarities

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Builds a similarity matrix with product IDs as the rows and headers and the similarity between each combination as
   the matrix value in that index. The diagonal is 1 because each product is 100% similar to itself.

   Similarity here is defined as the percentage of components that two products have in common. The matrix is not symmetric
   because each product can have a different number of components.
